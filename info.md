    **Algorithm Visualizer: Python Program Overview**

    Algorithm Visualizer is a Python program that showcases various sorting and pathfinding algorithms. It provides an interactive environment where users can observe the algorithms in action, gaining insights into their functionality and performance.

    **Sorting Algorithms:**
    - Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Tim, Bucket, Radix, and Count Sort.

    **Pathfinding Algorithms (Grid-based):**
    - BFS, Bi-BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*, IDA*, Floyd-Warshall, Bi-A*, and Bi-BFS.

    Users can select a sorting algorithm and provide an array to be sorted, or create a grid for pathfinding with start and end points, and optionally, obstacles. The program visualizes the algorithms' processes step by step, allowing users to understand their operations better.

    Enjoy exploring sorting and pathfinding algorithms with Algorithm Visualizer!
