# Algorithm Visualizer

## **Demo: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/_2_kYKESWco)**

This is a Python program that showcases various sorting and pathfinding algorithms. It uses the Pygame library for the graphical user interface and includes sound functionality for a more immersive user experience.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Tim Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort

## Pathfinding Algorithms

The following pathfinding algorithms are implemented:

- BFS Search
- Bi-BFS Search
- DFS Search
- Dijkstra Search
- A* Search
- IDA* Search
- Bi-A* Search
- Floyd Warshall Search

You can visualize these algorithms by running the `main_app.py` file.

## Sound Functionality

This application includes sound effects to enhance the visualization experience. The sounds are triggered by various events in the algorithms, such as comparisons or swaps in the sorting algorithms, and visiting a node in the pathfinding algorithms where sound depends upon the distance between current to destination node.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main_app.py

```
